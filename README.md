# My Custom Neovim Setup (NvChad)

This repository contains my customized Neovim configuration using [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad), tailored for web development with support for Python, Django, React, and Vue. It also includes powerful debugging capabilities for Python through `nvim-dap`.

## Features

- **NvChad Configuration**: A pre-configured Neovim setup that is modular and extensible.
- **Language Support**:
  - **Python**: Enhanced editing experience with LSP and autocompletion.
  - **Django**: Django-specific enhancements for a smoother development workflow.
  - **React**: Support for JSX syntax highlighting and code snippets.
  - **Vue**: Syntax highlighting and autocompletion for Vue components.
- **Debugging**: Integrated Python debugging with `nvim-dap`.

## Installation

1. **Install Neovim**: Ensure you have Neovim 0.7 or higher installed. Follow the [installation instructions here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim).
   
2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nvchad-config.git ~/.config/nvim

3. **Install Plugins**: Open Neovim and run:

4. **Setup Python Debugger**:
   Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install `nvim-dap` and any necessary adapters for Python. Hereâ€™s a quick setup guide:

5. **Configuration**:
   Customize the configuration files as needed. Check the `lua` directory for additional settings.
